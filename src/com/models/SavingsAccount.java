/*
 * Represents a savings account with interest accrual and minimum balance requirements.
 *
 * Savings accounts are designed for customers who want to earn interest on their deposits
 * while maintaining a minimum balance. These accounts have restrictions on withdrawals to
 * ensure the minimum balance requirement is maintained.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Annual interest rate of 3.5% (0.035)
 * - Minimum balance requirement of $500
 * - Withdrawals cannot reduce balance below $0
 * - Withdrawals must maintain the minimum balance requirement
 *
 * Withdrawal validation ensures that:
 * 1. The balance does not go below $0
 * 2. The balance after withdrawal meets the minimum balance requirement
